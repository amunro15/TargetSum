# TargetSum

##

Add-sum based mathematic game! Select four numbers to correctly sum to the number at the top. Selecting the correct four numbers updates the top number's container green. Incorrectly selecting four numbers updates the top number's container red. Not selecting four numbers before the timer runs out updates the top number's container red. Good luck!

## Local Development

Yse [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing versions of Node.js across Javascript projects. This repo contains a `.nvmrc` file which specifies the minimum compatible version of Node.js required for working with this application.

1. In a terminal window, navigate to your local copy of `TargetSum`.
2. If `nvm` is configured run `nvm use`, otherwise ensure your current version of Node.js meets or exceeds the version specified in `.nvmrc`.
3. Run `npx react-native start`.
4. Run `npx react-native run-ios`.
